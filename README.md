## SAS Viya on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys a highly available, production-ready SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning or SAS Visual Analytics on SAS Viya deployment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, into a configuration of your choice.

This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy the SAS Viya products into a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. You can build a new VPC for SAS Viya, or deploy the software into your existing VPC.
